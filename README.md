# 💳 Fintech Customer & Loan Behavior Analysis

This project explores a synthetic dataset from a fintech platform to understand customer profiles, financial behavior, and loan application outcomes. The goal is to derive actionable insights—not to predict the future—using descriptive analytics and data visualization.

## 🎯 Objective

To help fintech stakeholders identify patterns that affect loan approvals and understand how customer demographics and financial behavior relate to credit decisions.

## 📊 Key Insights

- 44.8% of loan applications were approved.
- Self-employed users had the highest approval rate (49.2%).
- Income and balance alone were **not strong predictors** of approval.
- Users with low deposit activity still showed healthy approval rates.
- Loan approval is influenced by a combination of behavioral and demographic factors—not a single variable.
